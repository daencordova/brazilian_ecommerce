# --- Database Configuration ---
# DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
# Format: postgres://user:password@host:port/database_name
# This example connects to a local PostgreSQL instance:
#   - User: username
#   - Password: password
#   - Host: localhost
#   - Port: 5432 (default PostgreSQL port)
#   - Database: database_name
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:port/database_name

# --- Server Configuration ---
# PORT: The network port on which the Axum server will listen for incoming HTTP requests.
PORT=3000

# --- Logging Configuration (Used by 'tracing') ---
# RUST_LOG: Specifies the logging level for modules.
# 'info' means it will log messages at the info, warn, and error levels.
RUST_LOG=info

# --- CORS Configuration (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ---
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: A comma-separated list of origins allowed to access the API.
# "*" means all origins are allowed (typical for development or public APIs).
# For production, use specific domains like 'https://myfrontend.com,https://api-dashboard.com'
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="*"

# CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS: If set to 'true', it allows the browser to send credentials
# (like cookies, HTTP authentication, or client-side SSL certificates) with the request.
# Set to 'false' if no cookies or authenticated requests are expected from cross-origins.
CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=false

# CORS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS: Specifies how long the results of a CORS preflight request (OPTIONS)
# can be cached by the client (browser). This reduces the number of OPTIONS requests.
# Value is in seconds. 3600 seconds = 1 hour.
CORS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=3600

# --- Application Environment ---
# APP_ENV: Defines the current operating environment of the application.
# Used for conditional logic, like setting up logging or, as in your code, the CORS policy.
# Typical values are 'development', 'staging', or 'production'.
APP_ENV=development
